# ugly_brute
 my learning studies when they drifted into brute forcing passwords

2408252137

everything i gathered on my investigations into brute forcing passwords that isn't embedded deep within some other project where it is probably more at home anyways.


the thing started out as a very early learn python project just because early on mild grey-hattery kept my interest and was one of the most fun ways to learn coding. ironically as time passed and myskills developed i also realised the code had application in things like my jellyfish benign traveller and the lobsterpot trapping device. it also rekindled an interest in the OEIS tables and the wonderful lists of integers hidden within - naturally these rabbit holes branched fractally into things on compact storage of cellular automata and ways to calculate the mayan calendar and much much more...


- the project is mostly written in Python though there is some C++ and possibly random pseudocode too /shrug.
- it is only a few hundred lines of code even at it's biggest and so self explanatory that if any find it lacking n documentation, a simple read through - the code will prove highly enlightening.
- ofc Python is by far a long way from idela for brute forcing, not being too fast or equipped with  all the wonderous tools some others have.
- as a result i did haev an interest in porting the BIG version to C++ and taking advantage of as much multi-threading and other streamlinings available.
- this is technically when embedded in an AI deep learning system and given the ability to evolve codewise and develop, able to perform some quite astonishing performance at cracking uinexpected hashes n stuff but your milage may vary - that is the real reason i kept it in python, because i was experiment alot with ai evolving code.

i feel bad for calling it ugly_brute - it really is quite pretty in my eyes because i didnt have the thing just templated vi fork from someone else but thought the whole thing upp from scratch and watched it grow from maybe 20 lines of code to a big beautiful conmplex lifeorm...
