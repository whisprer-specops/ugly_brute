so this was originally an independent learning exercie in studying Python coding.
inevitably it got too interesting and turned into a more significant project before becoming an essential building block in a nu mber of greater-whole advaced projects where it forms the main forced-decrypt block within the greater cod whole.

i guess this independent code reserch is now mostly just archival.
